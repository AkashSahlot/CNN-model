# CNN-model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used to process time series data by treating the time series as a one-dimensional sequence of data points.
Input Layer: The input layer of the CNN will take in the time series data as a one-dimensional sequence.
Convolutional Layers: The convolutional layers are used to extract features from the time series.
Activation Function: An activation function is applied to the output of the convolutional layer to introduce non-linearity into the model.  
Pooling Layers: The pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers. This helps to reduce the number of parameters in the model and prevent overfitting.
Fully Connected Layers: The fully connected layers take the output of the convolutional and pooling layers and produce the final output of the model. 
Output Layer: The output layer of the CNN will produce the prediction or classification result for the time series data.
